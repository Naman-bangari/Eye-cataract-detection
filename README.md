Eye Cataract Detection using VGG19: Key Steps
Data Preparation

Collect and Prepare Dataset: Gather eye images labeled with cataract and non-cataract categories, ensuring a balanced distribution.

Model Architecture

Load VGG19 Model: Use the pre-trained VGG19 model, excluding its top layer.
Freeze Layers: Prevent the pre-trained layers from being updated during training.
Add Custom Layers: Incorporate additional layers specific to cataract detection, such as Flatten, Dropout, and Dense layers.
Model Compilation

Optimizer and Loss Function: Choose an optimizer like Adam and a loss function such as binary cross-entropy.
Evaluation Metrics: Set accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
Model Training

Augmented Data: Train the model using the augmented dataset.
Callbacks: Implement ModelCheckpoint to save the best model and EarlyStopping to halt training if performance stops improving.
Model Evaluation

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model on a separate test set to measure its accuracy and loss.
